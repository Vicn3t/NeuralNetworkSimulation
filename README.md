# NeuralNetworkSimulation
This Java project simulates generations of creatures with different types of behavior. One behavior is controlled by a neural network of input and output neurons. At the end of each simulation, the chromosomes of the surviving creatures are collected based on certain conditions. A new generation of creatures is then created using the chromosomes of the parents.
